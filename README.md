# DigitalSealNOS

DigitalSealNOS is a .NET 8 application designed to provide cryptographic functionalities including key generation, file encryption/decryption, message digest calculation, and digital signing and signature verification. The application uses modern cryptographic algorithms to ensure the security and integrity of data.

## Features

- **Key Generation**: Generate and store symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic keys.
- **File Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt files using symmetric encryption (AES).
- **Message Digest Calculation**: Calculate the SHA-256 hash of a file.
- **Digital Signing**: Sign files using RSA and verify the signatures to ensure authenticity and integrity.

## Usage

1. **Generate Keys**: Click the "Generate Keys" button to create and store cryptographic keys.
2. **Encrypt File**: Select a file to encrypt and specify the output file path.
3. **Decrypt File**: Select an encrypted file to decrypt and specify the output file path.
4. **Calculate Message Digest**: Select a file to calculate its SHA-256 hash and specify the output file path.
5. **Sign File**: Select a file to sign and specify the output file path for the signature.
6. **Verify Signature**: Select a file and its signature to verify the authenticity and integrity of the file.
